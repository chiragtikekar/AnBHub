# Online Auction System  

## üìñ Introduction  
The **Online Auction System** is an innovative platform designed to connect buyers and sellers in a secure, efficient, and user-friendly environment. By enabling users to auction products online, the system ensures transparency and eliminates the challenges associated with traditional auctions, such as geographical and time constraints.  

This project was my first collaboratively developed as part of the **final semester of our diploma degree** to address real-world challenges in online auctioning and provide a modern solution for buyers and sellers.
